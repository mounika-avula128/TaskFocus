Task Manager Application

What Will You Build? 

TaskBuddy is a React-based task management application that will:

Add, delete, and mark tasks as complete: A dynamic task list that updates as you interact with it.

Persistent storage with localStorage: Your tasks will be saved even if you refresh the page.

Responsive design: The app will adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on desktops, tablets, and mobiles.

Additional features: Filtering tasks, clearing all tasks, and validating input to ensure data integrity.

Live deployment: By the end, youâ€™ll deploy the app to platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify, making it accessible to everyone.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
